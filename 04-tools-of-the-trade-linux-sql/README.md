# 🛠️ Linux & SQL Tools Practice

This folder contains my hands-on work from Course 4 of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. The focus was on building fluency with Linux command-line tools and using SQL to analyze and manage data.

## 🔹 Linux Skills
- Navigating the filesystem (`cd`, `pwd`, `ls`)
- File operations (`touch`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`)
- Permissions (`chmod`)
- Text processing tools (`cat`, `grep`, `echo`)

## 🔹 SQL Skills
- Writing queries to filter and analyze data
- Creating and modifying tables
- Using commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`

## 🧪 Sample Files
- `basic-linux-commands.txt` – My reference for terminal commands
- `practice-queries.sql` – Sample SQL statements practiced
- `notes.md` – Reflections and key takeaways from this module

This was a foundational part of my cybersecurity journey — understanding the tools used by professionals every day.
