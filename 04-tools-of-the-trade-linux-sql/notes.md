# üõ†Ô∏è Tools of the Trade ‚Äì Linux & SQL Practice Notes

## Linux Command Line
Practiced navigation, file manipulation, and permission handling. Got comfortable with:
- Navigating the filesystem using `cd`, `ls`, and `pwd`
- Creating and managing files using `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`
- File permissions via `chmod` and `ls -l`

## SQL Practice
Worked in browser-based SQL environments to:
- Create and manipulate tables
- Run basic queries like `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `JOIN`
- Perform data filtering and updates

## Challenges Faced
- Remembering command flags (e.g., `ls -l` vs `ls -a`)
- Syntax errors in SQL due to missed commas or quotes

## Wins
- Wrote my first fully working SQL script!
- Can now navigate the Linux terminal confidently
